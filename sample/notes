- write a test with the url hard coded
--- but then how about environemnts? better make it a config

- I think the login negative test is best starting point
    -- hard code the email
    -- mention will create a helper for random email
    --
- Second test case is for registration
    -- this tiem craete the function to create random email

-- AT CHECKOUT AS A GUEST, CLICK ON CREATE ACCOUNT
-- additiona informatin field, then check the db
-- clicking on the create account, displayes the password field

- database helpers to check order is in db
- api helpers to check user is actually created
- api helper to find product id and verify it is there
- api helper to find coupons
- create user and verify by calling api
- may be do other tests before doing end to end
